TODO LATER, LIMITATIONS:

- api tests - check the update failure bad request

- mocking apis - maybe use some api ends points interchanably for demo purposes,  if possible.
in the page objects

- for the data-driven approach, faker, maybe a sample with for loop if possible, maybe add new account 
to have multiple accounts a tests a transfer with for loops ??
